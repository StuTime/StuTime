# ðŸ“˜ StuTime

**StuTime** is a smarter way to manage your time â€” built specifically for students who want more structure, less stress, and better focus. Unlike traditional calendar apps that just show you whatâ€™s next, StuTime helps you *feel* the time â€” with countdowns, visuals, and reminders that make it easier to stay on track and in control.

## ðŸ§  Why StuTime Exists

Letâ€™s be real â€” school is overwhelming. Between lectures, labs, homework, club meetings, workouts, and everything in between, itâ€™s easy to lose track of where your time is going. Traditional calendar apps werenâ€™t designed with students in mind â€” and they certainly donâ€™t motivate you to stay focused.

StuTime was created to change that.

## âœ¨ What Makes StuTime Different

* **Countdown-Based Focus:**
  Donâ€™t just *see* whatâ€™s next â€” *feel* the urgency. StuTime uses live countdown timers to show you exactly how much time you have until your next class, deadline, or break.

* **Dynamic Schedule Awareness:**
  Whether your schedule changes weekly or you have rotating blocks, StuTime adapts â€” pulling from your actual calendar and updating in real-time.

* **Beautifully Minimal UI:**
  Inspired by Apple-style design, StuTime is clean, modern, and distraction-free. Built to help you focus, not fidget.

* **AI-Powered Tools (Coming Soon):**
  Scan your syllabus. Auto-import class schedules. Plan study blocks around your workload. StuTimeâ€™s AI features are built to save you time and energy.

* **Live Activities on iOS:**
  Track your next event without opening the app â€” right from your Lock Screen or Dynamic Island.
